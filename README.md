## 🧠 Why Bellman–Ford Algorithm?

The given graph contains **negative edge weights**, therefore **Dijkstra’s Algorithm is not suitable**.  
The **Bellman–Ford Algorithm** is used because:
- It supports **negative weight edges**
- It finds shortest paths correctly
- It can detect negative weight cycles
